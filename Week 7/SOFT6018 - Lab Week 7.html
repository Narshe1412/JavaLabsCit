				<H1>Lab Week 7 -  Simple Lottery </H1>
				<HR>
				
				<P>Write a program which will simulate the National Lottery but on a smaller scale.</P>	
				<P>For the purposes of this simple lottery a player's ticket has one line with three numbers. The numbers available are <b>0-10</b> (inclusive)</P>
				<P>This program only really has one use case which would be "Play The Lottery". The use case would look something like this. Use cases
often need clarification so ask me if you need clarification.</P>
				<OL>
					<LI>A user should be prompted if they would like to buy a ticket. The numbers on a tickets are generated by doing a QuickPick (i.e. Have the numbers randomly generated for them)</LI>
					<LI>The draw runs and three random numbers are picked. These are the lottery draw numbers.</LI>
					<LI>The users ticket is checked against the lottery numbers to see if they have won. An appropriate message should be displayed if they have some number matches.</LI>
					<LI>After each draw the user should be prompted if they would like to play again.</LI>
					<LI>Prizes are as follows :
							<UL>
								<LI>Match 1 - Win 1 euro</LI>
								<LI>Match 2 - Win 5 euro</LI>
								<LI>Match 3 - Win 10 euro</LI>
							</UL>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						 Keep track of the players balance.
							<UL>
								<LI>They start with 10 euro.</LI>
								<LI>Each play costs them 1 euro which should be deducted from their balance.</LI>
								<LI>Wins should be added to their balance.</LI>
								<LI>Current balance should be printed after each draw.</LI>
							</UL>						 
					</LI>
					<LI>The game should end if the user decides they don't want to play again <pre>OR</pre> if they run out of money.</LI>
				</OL>
				<P>Start with some pseudo code for the main method to get you thinking about how your program will run. Then think about  : </P>
				<UL>
					<LI>Classes and methods you may need to create.</LI>
					<LI>Variables you will need and, where you need them and what their scope should be.</LI>
				</UL>
				<P>If you are struggling and need a kick start then look at my partial solutions here to get you started</P>
				<P>Feel free to adjust this code if you wish. There are lots of different ways of solving this lab</P>

				</UL>
				<P>For the purposes of this program don't worry if they same random number gets generated twice on the users ticket (or in the draw).</P>
