Lab Week 7 - Simple Lottery
Write a program which will simulate the National Lottery but on a smaller scale.

For the purposes of this simple lottery a player's ticket has one line with three numbers. 
The numbers available are 0-10 (inclusive)


A user should be prompted if they would like to buy a ticket. 
The numbers on a tickets are generated by doing a QuickPick (i.e. Have the numbers randomly generated for them)
The draw runs and three random numbers are picked. These are the lottery draw numbers.
The users ticket is checked against the lottery numbers to see if they have won. 
An appropriate message should be displayed if they have some number matches.

After each draw the user should be prompted if they would like to play again.
Prizes are as follows :
	Match 1 - Win 1 euro
	Match 2 - Win 5 euro
	Match 3 - Win 10 euro
Keep track of the players balance.
	They start with 10 euro.
	Each play costs them 1 euro which should be deducted from their balance.
	Wins should be added to their balance.
	Current balance should be printed after each draw.

The game should end if the user decides they don't want to play again
	OR
if they run out of money.

##Start
